DEPRECATED: Display finger positions from LucidGloves in Blender

This was my first on-PC demo of [LucidGloves](https://github.com/LucidVR/lucidgloves-hardware), through a python script in Blender.

See it working here:

This code is now deprecated as [OpenGloves](https://github.com/LucidVR/opengloves-driver) is now used instead for function of the gloves.
This repository will not be maintained. Feel free to fork and maintain as needed :)

Known issues:
The script may stop working after a few seconds when running on Windows. Recommended to use Linux or OSX instead for more reliable operation.

This code extends on the knowledge from this tutorial:
